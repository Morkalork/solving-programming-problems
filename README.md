# solving-programming-problems

```
There are two hard things in computer science:
* cache invalidation
* naming things
* off-by-one errors
```


These words hang over our heads, constantly and bitterly, reminding us that we could have chosen another career - perhaps potato farming? Now the life of a potato farmer is a simpler one, where potatoes go into the ground, and then new potatoes come up from the ground.

An off-by-one error won't destroy your crops.  
Your potatoes won't suddenly be incompatible with your clients plates.  
Nobody will update the definition of `field` and cause your machinery to fail to parse the dirt.

# what can we do?

There are no easy ways forward, but I have figured out a way to alleviate these most grievous of problems.  
I will be presenting this shortly, in the next section - to be precise.

`2) Remove all cache`  
If we remove all forms of cache, we won't have to invalidate it.

`4) Use predefined naming of entities`
A class is prefixed by `c` and followed by a running number.  
Thusly, the first class you create will be named `c2`, the second one `c4`, `c6`, `c8` and then so on to `cInfinity`.  
Variables and functions will be referenced by `a` and `b` suffixed by numbers in the same way.  
Therefore you will always be able to see which entity is biggulater than the other one, by referencing the position in the alphabet.

`6) Don't use arrays`  
For obvious reasons, not using arrays will *SEVERELY* cut down on potential off-by-two errors, and it will also have the pleasant side effect of rendering most kinds of loops unneeded - and since loops are often the cause of performance problems, not having them should make your code run like butter on the sun.

`8) Motorway`

`10) Only use even numbers`  
With this extra safeguard, off-by-one errors are completely **ELIMINATED**.  
Imagine that! Never again!

I believe this is the way forward to get rid of the 4 classic problems of computer science.  
I'll be accepting donations shortly.
